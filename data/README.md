The Delaney dataset is from the deepchem project [https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/datasets/delaney-processed.csv](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/datasets/delaney-processed.csv). It is based on the 2004 paper by John Delaney [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci034243x](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci034243x).

In the future, the DLS-100 dataset may prove to be interesting [https://doi.org/10.17630/3a3a5abc-8458-4924-8e6c-b804347605e8](https://doi.org/10.17630/3a3a5abc-8458-4924-8e6c-b804347605e8)
